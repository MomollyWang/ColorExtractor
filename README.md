# Color Palette Extractor 

Our project focuses on extracting color pallete of an image using  KMeans clustering algorithm. The basic idea is to treat each pixel in the image as a data point with a three-dimensional feature vector representing the pixel's RGB values. Then, the k-means algorithm is applied to cluster the data points into k clusters, where k is a pre-defined parameter. The resulting cluster centers represent the dominant colors in the image.
